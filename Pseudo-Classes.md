## Pseudo Classes
Before getting started with pseudo classes, let us first understand what the word pseudo means,
a simple google search gives you: <br/>

*__Pseudo: not genuine; spurious or sham.__* <br/>

A pseudo class is basically a pseudo state of element which can be later targeted with CSS.
They are always preceded by a `:`. Some examples could be `:visited`, `:hover` etc.

## Why do we need them, afterall?
Consider the following codeblock: <br/>
```css
h1:hover {
color:blue;
}
```
